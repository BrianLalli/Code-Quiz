# Code-Quiz


## Project Description:
The task was to create a random password generator for my coding bootcamp. First, the user must click the 'Generate Password' button to prompt a question which asks how many characters the user wants their password to be. Then it continues to ask conditional questions based on the type of characters the user wants to include: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters (standard is to include all but in this task we let the user decide). After, the program will randomly choose characters based on the user criteria and generate a password.

* Prompt = length
* Create var to hold answer to prompt
* Conditional if else statement to ensure user answer to prompt is within range
* Confirm = lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters
* Conditional if else to validate user answers and combine all arrays in 1 array
* Function to randomly capture user determined # of characters from the combined array
* Change function to a string to generate and return password

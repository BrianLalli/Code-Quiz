# Code-Quiz


## Project Description:
The task was to create a quiz where the user must start by clicking a button to trigger a timer and the first question. The user can pick from one of 4 answer choices and if they are correct the move forward to the next question with no penalty. If the user is incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. After the user has answerered all 5 questions, they are prompted to insert their initials for a high scores list.
